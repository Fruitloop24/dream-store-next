## Quick Start

Open this project in **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or **Windsurf** and run:

```
/setup
```

That's it. The AI walks you through everything:
- 🔑 **API Key** - Paste your publishable key, done
- 🏪 **Branding** - Tell it your store name, it sets up the vibe
- 🎨 **Theme** - Dark mode for sneakers? Light for handmade goods? Done
- 📝 **Pages** - About page, contact info, all customized

**"I sell vintage vinyl records"** → Done. Styled. Ready to launch.

## Why Dream API?

You want to sell stuff online. You don't want to become a Stripe expert or figure out cart state management. You definitely don't want to debug webhooks at 3am.

**Dream API handles all of it.** Products in dashboard. Payments just work.

**This template is the storefront. Your dashboard is the back office.**

---

## Your Dashboard

Your Dream API dashboard is your back office:

- **Add products** (name, price, images, description)
- **Update inventory** levels
- **Upload images** (drag & drop)
- **View orders** and revenue

**Add products → Your store updates instantly.** No deploy needed.

---

## Guest Checkout

No accounts. No passwords. No friction.

Customer adds to cart → Clicks checkout → Stripe handles payment → Done.

Stripe collects their email and shipping. You get paid. They get their stuff.

---

## Manual Setup

Prefer doing it yourself? No problem.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fruitloop24/dream-store-next.git my-store
cd my-store
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your publishable key to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DREAM_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 - your store is running.

### The Config File

Everything lives in `lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const config = {
  storeName: 'Vinyl Vault',
  tagline: 'Rare finds for serious collectors',
  theme: 'dark',
  accentColor: 'amber',  // emerald, sky, violet, rose, amber, zinc
}
```

---

## The Stack

```
Next.js 14            App router, server components
Tailwind CSS          Style anything
Dream API SDK         Products, cart, checkout - done
Stripe (under hood)   Battle-tested payments
```

You don't configure Stripe. You don't build a cart. You just sell.

---

## Deploy

**Vercel** (recommended):
```bash
npm run build
# Connect repo to Vercel, add NEXT_PUBLIC_DREAM_PUBLISHABLE_KEY env var
```

**Cloudflare Pages**:
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy .next
```

This is how we think e-commerce should work:
- **Products in dashboard** - Not in code
- **AI-assisted branding** - Describe your vibe, we'll style it
- **Zero payment config** - Stripe just works

**What's missing? What would make you actually use this?**
